# INFO-201-Final-Project
Final project for INFO 201 UW
Summary
At the beginning of the project, we decided to tackle the issue of high obesity rates in America. We wanted to find out what could be the most important factors that impact the current rates of obesity so we downloaded many different files including obesity rates by race, average incomes, smoking rates, and education levels. However, after feedback and reflection we decided that we had too many data sets on our hands so we narrowed down to solely education levels and average incomes. We formatted the data frames to be identical so that the columns could merge together seamlessly and we made 4 graphs from this combined data frame. The first 3 graphs showed the relationship between obesity rates and the level of education in each state, and the 4th graph showed the relationship between obesity rates and the average annual household incomes by state. We conclude that education and income do indeed have an impact on obesity, but there are still many more factors to comb through when considering our question of what impacts obesity the most. With the aim of informing policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers, we hope our insights contribute to a more informed public discourse on health. Our main key takeaway is that obesity in America is a complex problem, and needs thorough research of all aspects of life to determine the main causes of this disease.
